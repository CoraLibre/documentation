# Welcome to CoraLibre

informational resources as well as links to such, that have been used 
during the development of CoraLibre, or might help developers in the 
future.
While it is primarily intended as a source of information for the 
CoraLibre developers, it might as well be of interest to anyone who 
wants to dive deeper into the inner workings of CoraLibre and the 
Exposure Notification Protocol.
