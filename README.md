# CoraLibre documentation

This site/repository serves as a collection of documentational and informational resources as well as links to such, that have been used during the development of CoraLibre, or might help developers in the future.
While it is primarily intended as a source of information for the CoraLibre developers, it might as well be of interest to anyone who wants to dive deeper into the inner workings of CoraLibre and the Exposure Notification Protocol.

An [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site is generated from the **mkdocs.yaml** file and the contents of the **docs** folder. The site can be reached under <https://coralibre.github.io/documentation/>.
